The Software Ideas Generator is a simple Python program that generates random software ideas by combining different keywords. It can be used as a starting point for brainstorming new software projects or as a fun exercise to stimulate creativity.

## How it Works
The program uses predefined lists of keywords, such as "Application," "System," "Platform," and "Tool," along with actions like "management," "monitoring," and "optimization," to create unique software ideas. It randomly selects words from these lists and combines them to generate a software idea. Additionally, it can optionally include an extension phrase like "for businesses," "for learning," or others to further enhance the idea.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7 or above

## Usage
1. Clone the repository or download the `software_ideas_generator.py` file.
2. Make sure you have Python 3.7 or above installed on your system.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the `software_ideas_generator.py` file is located.
4. Run the following command to execute the program:
